This is a simple TODO application developed using Spring Boot framework, which allows users to manage their tasks in a convenient manner. The application uses an ArrayList as the data structure to store the tasks.


---

## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---

## Language Used
* Java

---

## Data Model

The user data model is defined in the User class, which has the following attributes:

```

todoName : String
todoStatus : Boolean
lastDate : String

```

## Data Flow

1. The user sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.

4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.
