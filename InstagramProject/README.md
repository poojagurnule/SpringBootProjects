## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---
<br>

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok
* Validation
* Swagger

<br>

## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```
<br>

## Language Used
* Java

<br>

> ## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.
>## Schema
The following schemas are used in the project:

* **User:** Represents user information including user ID, name, Instagram details, password, email, phone number, blue tick status, and date of birth.
* **SignUpOutput:** Contains the status and message of the sign-up operation.
SignInInput: Includes the email and password for user authentication during sign-in.
* **SignInOutput:** Provides the status and token after successful user authentication.
* **Post:** Represents a post with a post ID, creation date, post data, caption, location, and associated user.
* **PostLike:** Represents a like given to a post, including the like ID, the post being liked, and the user who liked it.
* **InstagramComment:** Represents a comment on a post, including the comment ID, comment body, the post being commented on, and the user who made the comment.

Please note that the actual implementation and details of these schemas may vary within the project code.
